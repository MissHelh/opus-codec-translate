<h1>Opus licensing</h1>

<p>Opus has a freely available specification, a BSD-licensed, high-quality reference
encoder and decoder, and protective, royalty-free licenses for the required patents.
The copyright and patent licenses for Opus are automatically granted to everyone and
do not require application or approval. The Opus FAQ has
more information on <a href="https://wiki.xiph.org/OpusFAQ#Why_make_Opus_free.3F">why

<h2>Copyright</h2>

<h3>Specification</h3>

<p>The specification is freely available as part of <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6716">IETF RFC 6716</a>. The RFC includes the reference implementation, which is available
under the three-clause BSD license (see below).</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Both the reference implementation and the revised implementations on opus-codec.org are available under the three-clause BSD license. This BSD license is compatible with all common open source and commercial software licenses.</p>

</div>
</blockquote>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>Most of the command-line Ogg-based tools that are shipped as part of the separate opus-tools package are also released under the three-clause BSD license.
The only exception is the opusinfo tool, which is released under the GPLv2 license.
Proprietary software developers wishing to use Opus may copy code from opusenc and opusdec, but they may not
copy code from the opusinfo tool to build their applications.</p>

<h2>Patents</h2>

<p>Opus is covered by several patents. These
patents are available under open-source-compatible, royalty-free licenses. If you are not trying to attack Opus
with your patents, you will not have problems with these licenses.</p>

<p>Some of these licenses have been updated in the past and may be updated again in the future. However, 
updates never invalidate the old licenses and users are always free to rely on any of the previously
available licenses. In other words, newer licenses can give more rights, but never fewer.</p>

<a name="xiph"><h3>Xiph.Org Foundation</h3></a>

<p>The Xiph.Org foundation has several patent applications on techniques used in Opus. When issued, these patents will be automatically available under the terms provided in the below license. The license
covers the listed patent applications, along with any other patent or application covering Opus that is owned by Xiph.Org.</p>

<p>Microsoft Opus Patent Terms</p>
<p>11-7-2012</p>
<p>1. Patent Terms.</p>

<p>1.1. Specification License. Subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I, on behalf of myself and my successors in interest and assigns, hereby grant you a non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to my Necessary Decoder Claims for your Specification Implementation.</p>

<p>1.2. Code License. Subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I, on behalf of myself and my successors in interest and assigns, hereby grant you a non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to my Necessary Reference Implementation Claims to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import or distribute a Code Implementation.</p>

<p>1.3. Conditions.</p>

<p>1.3.1. Availability. If you own or control Necessary Claims, the licenses set forth in Section 1 are subject to and will become effective starting on the date that you make a binding public irrevocable commitment to license, on reasonable and non-discriminatory royalty-free licensing terms 1) your Necessary Decoder Claims to all implementers for Specification Implementations, and 2) your Necessary Reference Implementation Claims to all implementers for Code Implementations, where the terms of this Agreement satisfy any reciprocity requirements in your reasonable and non-discriminatory royalty-free licensing terms. The promises set forth in Section 1 will remain in effect so long as you continue to make such claims available for Specification Implementations and Code Implementations under reasonable and non-discriminatory royalty-free licensing terms. In addition, as a condition of the licenses set forth in Section 1, you acknowledge and agree that you have not and will not knowingly take any action for the purpose of circumventing the conditions in this Section 1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are not required to make the commitments set forth in this Section 1.3.1 as a result of merely using a Specification Implementation or a Code Implementation as an end-user.</p>

<p>1.3.2. Additional Conditions. This license is directly from me to you and you acknowledge as a condition of benefiting from it that no rights from me are received from suppliers, distributors, or otherwise in connection with this license. This license is not an assurance (i) that any of my issued patent claims covers a Specification Implementation or Code Implementation or are enforceable or (ii) that a Specification Implementation or Code Implementation would not infringe intellectual property rights of any third party.</p>

<p>1.4. Termination. All rights, grants, and promises made by me to you under Section 1 are immediately terminated if you or your agent file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in a lawsuit against me or any person or entity asserting that a Specification Implementation infringes Necessary Decoder Claims or a Code Implementation infringes Necessary Reference Implementation Claims, unless that suit was in response to a corresponding suit regarding a Specification Implementation or Code Implementation first brought against you. In addition, all rights, grants, and promises made by me to you under Section 1 are terminated if you, your agent, or successor in interest seek to license Necessary Decoder Claims for Specification Implementations or Necessary Reference Implementations Claims for Code Implementations on a royalty-bearing basis, unless that royalty-bearing licensing activity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, reasonable and non-discriminatory royalty-free licensing terms for Necessary Decoder Claims for Specification Implementations or Necessary Reference Implementation Claims for Code Implementations. This Agreement may also be terminated, including back to the date of non-compliance, because of non-compliance with any other term or condition of this Agreement.</p>

<p>2. Patent License Commitment. On behalf of me and my successors in interest and assigns, I agree to offer alternative reasonable and non-discriminatory royalty-bearing licensing terms 1) to my Necessary Decoder Claims solely for your Specification Implementation and 2) to my Necessary Reference Implementations Claims solely for your Code Implementation.</p>

<p>3. Past Skype Declarations. You may, at your option, continue to rely on the terms set forth in Skype‚Äôs past declarations made to the IETF for the Opus Audio Codec, subject to the terms of those declarations and in lieu of the terms of this Agreement solely for the patents set forth in those declarations.</p>

<p>4. Good Faith Obligations. I agree that I have not and will not knowingly take any action for the purpose of circumventing my obligations under this Agreement. In addition, I will not 1) seek an injunction or exclusion order against a) Code Implementations for Necessary Reference Implementation Claims or b) Specification Implementations for Necessary Decoder Claims or 2) require that an implementer license its patents back to me, except for Necessary Reference Implementation Claims for Code Implementations and Necessary Decoder Claims for Specification Implementations. I will not transfer Necessary Reference Implementation Claims or Necessary Decoder Claims unless the transferee is subject to these obligations.</p>

<p>5. Disclaimers. I expressly disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to the Specification or Reference Implementation. The entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the Specification, Specification Implementation, or Code Implementation is assumed by the implementer and user. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. Nothing in this Agreement requires me to undertake a patent search.</p>

<p>6. Definitions.</p>

<p>6.1. Agreement. ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù means this document, which sets forth the rights, grants, limitations, conditions, obligations, and disclaimers made available for the particular Specification.</p>

<p>6.2. Code Implementation. ‚ÄúCode Implementation‚Äù means making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing or distributing 1) the Reference Implementation, or 2) an implementation that, in the case of an encoder, produces a bitstream that can be decoded by a Specification Implementation solely to the extent it produces such a bitstream, and, in the case of decoder, is a Specification Implementation, where that Specification Implementation may also infringe Necessary Reference Implementation Claims.</p>

<p>6.3. Control. ‚ÄúControl‚Äù means direct or indirect control of more than 50% of the voting power to elect directors of that corporation, or for any other entity, the power to direct management of such entity.</p>

<p>6.4. I, Me, or My. ‚ÄúI,‚Äù ‚Äúme,‚Äù or ‚Äúmy‚Äù refers to the party making this declaration, and any entity that I Control.</p>

<p>6.5. Necessary Claims. ‚ÄúNecessary Claims‚Äù means Necessary Decoder Claims and Necessary Reference Implementation Claims.</p>

<p>6.6. Necessary Decoder Claims. ‚ÄúNecessary Decoder Claims‚Äù are those patent claims that a party owns or controls, including those claims acquired after the date of this declaration, that are necessarily infringed by an implementation of the required portions (including the required elements of optional portions) of the decoder Specification that are described in detail and not merely referenced in the Specification.</p>

<p>6.7. Necessary Reference Implementation Claims. ‚ÄúNecessary Reference Implementation Claims‚Äù are those patent claims that a party owns or controls, including those claims acquired after the date of this declaration, that are necessarily infringed by the Reference Implementation. Necessary Reference Implementation Claims do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the Reference Implementation.</p>

<p>6.8. Reference Implementation. ‚ÄúReference Implementation‚Äù means the implementation of the Opus encoder and/or decoder code extracted from Appendix A of the Specification.</p>

<p>6.9. Specification. ‚ÄúSpecification‚Äù means IETF RFC 6716 dated September 2012.</p>

<p>6.10. Specification Implementation. ‚ÄúSpecification Implementation‚Äù means making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing or distributing any conformant implementation of the decoder set forth in the Specification 1) only to the extent it implements the Specification and 2) so long as all required portions of the Specification are implemented. Specification Implementation also includes any implementation of a decoder included in subsequent versions of RFC 6716 1) only to the extent that it implements the decoder Specification, and 2) so long as all required portions of the decoder Specification are implemented.</p>

<p>6.11. You or Your. ‚ÄúYou,‚Äù ‚Äúyou,‚Äù or ‚Äúyour‚Äù means any person or entity who exercises patent rights granted under this Agreement, and any person or entity you Control.</p>

This license is also filed on the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/1914/">IETF site</a>. The

<a name="other"><h3>Other disclosures</h3></a>

<p>
While Xiph.Org, Broadcom, and Microsoft filed IPR disclosures giving
 royalty-free licenses to their patents used in Opus, four companies that did
 not directly participate in the development of Opus, Qualcomm, Huawei, France Telecom, and Ericsson,
 filed IPR disclosures with potentially royalty-bearing terms.
The IETF allows <i>anyone</i> (and their dog) to file an IPR disclosures if
 they <i>think</i> that their patents "covers or <i>may</i> ultimately cover"
 a standard.
In fact, for any organization who can be said to have <i>contributed</i> in any
 (very loosely defined) way, these IPR statements are not just allowed, but
 required.
It is thus safer for organisations to declare as much as they can.
As an example, one can find similar non-free Qualcomm IPR statements on both
 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/1390/">SIP</a> and
 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/1389/">SDP</a>.
To our advantage, however, the IETF IPR disclosure policies require companies
 to provide the actual patent numbers.
This allows anyone to verify these claims for themselves, which is definitely
 a good thing.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to patents, it is difficult to say much without
 making lawyers nervous.
However, we can say something quite direct: <b>external counsel Dergosits & Noah has advised us that Opus can be
 implemented without the need to license the patents disclosed by Qualcomm,
 Huawei, France Telecom, or Ericsson</b>.
We can also say that Mozilla is confident enough in Opus to ship it to hundreds
 of millions of Firefox users.
Similarly, Cisco and Google are also supporting Opus in some products.
More companies are expected to do the same soon.
</p>

<p>
Mozilla invested significant legal resources into avoiding known patent
 thickets when designing Opus.
Whenever possible, we used processes and methods that have been long known in
 the field and which are considered patent-free.
In addition, we filed numerous patent applications on the new things we 
 invented to help defend the Opus community.
As a result, Opus is available on a royalty-free basis and can be deployed by
 anyone, including other open-source projects.
Everyone knows this is an incredibly challenging legal environment to operate
 in, but we think we've succeeded.
